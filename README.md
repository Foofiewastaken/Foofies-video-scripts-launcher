I don't always upload new release whn I just work with scripts, so if you want the newest scripts download them from the code
If you want to add your own scripts, put them in a .bat file, and put it into Scripts
All your downloaded videos, sounds and music will be in the Downloads folder


It's kind of a fork of https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp


I expect you to already have Python 3.11 as not everything is an exe, and there are bare .py files. Maybe some time in the future I'll put everything into one exe, or just build smaller execs that won't require python, but idk, I'm a begginer
